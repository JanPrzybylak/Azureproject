Imagine a compact, intelligent device that can seamlessly integrate with all your household appliances—from your lights and fans to your kettle and washing machine. Our ThunderCheck Smart House connects to each appliance in your home, tracking electricity usage in real-time and allowing you to monitor and manage your energy consumption with ease. By analyzing data in the cloud, this device provides valuable insights into your energy habits and offers recommendations to optimize usage, all while giving you the power to control appliances remotely.

  Key Features

1. Universal Appliance Compatibility
The ThunderCheck Smart House is designed to be compatible with most home appliances. It connects with a range of devices, including lamps, fans, kettles, washing machines, heaters, and more, enabling them to "speak" to each other and to you. Setup is simple, with plug-and-play capabilities for quick integration into your smart home ecosystem.

2. Real-Time Monitoring of Energy Consumption
Track the power usage of individual appliances as well as your home’s total consumption. The device continuously monitors and records electricity usage data, which is then securely sent to the cloud. This provides you with a comprehensive, minute-by-minute view of how much energy each device consumes.

3. Remote Control via Mobile App
Access and manage your home appliances from anywhere, at any time. Through an intuitive mobile app, you can turn appliances on or off, set schedules, and adjust settings. This remote control feature enhances convenience and allows you to ensure no appliance is accidentally left on, even when you’re away from home.

4. Smart Energy Recommendations
Utilizing data from your usage patterns, the cloud service generates personalized energy-saving tips and suggestions. If your energy usage spikes or exceeds recommended levels, the service will alert you and provide actionable insights on reducing consumption. These tips can include adjusting appliance settings, scheduling high-power tasks during off-peak hours, or replacing high-energy devices with more efficient ones.

5. Automated Alerts and Safety Measures
The ThunderCheck Smart House also offers an added layer of safety. It sends automated alerts if an appliance is drawing an unusual amount of power, signaling potential malfunction or overheating. This feature helps prevent electrical hazards and extends the lifespan of your appliances.

6. Energy Cost Insights and Forecasting
The system offers real-time updates on how much your energy usage costs. By tracking consumption trends, the device can forecast your monthly energy bill, enabling you to make informed adjustments before costs escalate.

7. Customizable Automation and Scheduling
Users can create custom schedules and automate certain appliances based on daily routines. For example, you can program lights to turn off when you leave the house or have the coffee maker start brewing when your alarm goes off. This not only saves energy but enhances daily convenience.

  Privacy and Security
Data privacy and security are top priorities for our device. All communication between the device, the cloud, and your mobile app is encrypted. User data is stored securely, and users retain full control over how their data is used.
