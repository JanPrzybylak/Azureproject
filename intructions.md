## Key Features

1. **Universal Appliance Compatibility**
   - ThunderCheck connects to a wide range of household devices, including lamps, fans, kettles, TVs, toasters, and more. It's designed to be plug-and-play for easy integration into any smart home setup.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring of Energy Consumption**
   - Monitor power usage for individual appliances as well as the total energy consumed by the entire home. The system continuously tracks energy usage and sends data to the cloud.

3. **Remote Control via MQTT**
   - Control appliances remotely via MQTT by sending commands to the `iot/devices/commands` topic. You can turn appliances on or off from anywhere.

4. **Smart Energy Recommendations (TO DO)**
   - Based on energy usage patterns, ThunderCheck provides personalized energy-saving tips to optimize consumption.

5. **Automated Alerts and Safety Measures (TO DO)**
   - Receive alerts if an appliance is consuming too much power, indicating potential issues like malfunction or overheating.

6. **Energy Cost Insights and Forecasting (TO DO)**
   - Track your energy costs in real-time and forecast your monthly energy bills based on consumption trends.

7. **Customizable Automation and Scheduling (TO DO)**
   - Set up schedules to automate appliance usage based on your daily routines. For example, program your lights to turn off when you leave or set your coffee maker to start brewing at your wake-up time.

8. **Privacy and Security (TO DO)**
   - All communication between devices and the cloud is encrypted, ensuring secure and private data handling.
